# Key-Logger-Detection
Python doesn't have direct access to OS-level keylogging detection mechanisms like some antivirus software,but it can still help in detecting suspicious behavior by monitoring memory & cpu usage, files, network,windows event logs.

# Memory Inspection for Suspicious Libraries
we can Analyze running processes and inspect their memory for the presence of suspicious libraries or modules (eg. pynput, keyboard, win32api).
# Process Monitoring
unusual system resource consumption, or long-running processes that might indicate a keylogger.
# File Monitoring
monitor your filesystem for any suspicious log files being created in directories like temp, AppData, or even within Python scripts.
# Network Activity Monitoring
monitor network traffic and identify unusual or continuous connections, especially from suspicious processes as some keyloggers transmit logged data over the network.
# Integration with Windows Event Logs
Keyloggers often leave traces in Windows Event Logs, especially when interacting with keyboard input or using system hooks. We can use pywin32 to access Windows Event Logs.
